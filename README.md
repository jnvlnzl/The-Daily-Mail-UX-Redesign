# The Daily Mail UX Redesign

The Daily Mail's website is a high-traffic news platform, but its user experience is a mix of strengths and weaknesses. It features frequent multimedia content, including videos and images, but suffers from issues such as intrusive ads, a cluttered layout, and inconsistent navigation. Users often find it challenging to focus on the main content due to excessive clickbait tactics and overwhelming headlines, which can lead to cognitive overload. While the search functionality is robust, enabling users to find content quickly, the site lacks strong accessibility features, such as customizable text sizes and screen reader support.

The website has a multi-level hierarchy with a main menu that organizes content into sections like News, Showbiz, Sports, and Health. While this menu provides clear navigation, the inconsistency of sub-menu items and scattered links within articles often lead to user confusion. Social media integration is prominent, allowing for quick content sharing, but navigation can become tedious due to overcrowded sections.

The following are the proposed improvements:

- Reduce some of the clutter in the original website
- Still allows the users to view lots of articles at a time
- Keep some of the fonts and colors of the original site to not alienate the base completely
- Maintain the original user experience while possibly making it more usable to a wider base
- Make the website better scale for mobile resolutions
